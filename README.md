# CS340 Portfolio (Bryan Chan)


#### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
- A developer can develop programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by adopting design patterns, which incorporates uniformity and familiarity to a program. For example, this program utilzies the MVC design pattern. This design pattern forces the developer to developer the program into three fundamental components, which will work in unity in order to provide the functionalities of the program. By developing in this way, I was able to reduce the complexities of debugging the programming, by focusing on each component instead of searching for bugs in a single program.

#### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
- As a computer scientist, I approach various problems by breaking down their complexities and functionalities into simple components. This was evident in this program, since it was broken down into three components, thus fufilling the MVC design pattern. This approach differed from other assignments in past courses, which did not emphasize this approach to seperating the program into components. The MVC design pattern would be a strategy that I would employ in future assignments that deal with a client/server relationship.
  

#### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
- Computer Scientists develop programs and solve problems by employing a series of patterns and techniques. This mindset can better server companies in improving their workflow by implementing solutions that will better fufill their requirements, rather than a generic solution that is not tailored to their product.
